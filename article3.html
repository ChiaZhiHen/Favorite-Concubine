                        <p class="send__description">Beauty is important, but when you go back and look at the pictures of ancient concubines, you will find that they are actually pretty ordinary. This is because ancient marriages were mostly political marriages, just for the country to get along with other tribes, or for ministers to continue to be loyal to the country. The emperor could not give too much love to the beautiful concubine but with weak family background, because her family could not do much to help the emperor's affairs. If you give too much pampering, you will be regarded as a bane of the country.</p>
